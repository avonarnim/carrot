carrot-chrome-extension

Carrot's the very first app I've ever coded from scratch! 

It takes your currently opened tabs and organizes them into groups in our chrome extension popup. I'll be adding more features over time, but the first thing I wanted to deal with was the common problem of having WAY too many tabs open at once.
